## Multiplayer game implementation, Fall 2019

University of Helsinki, course: [Networked Systems and Services](https://courses.helsinki.fi/fi/csm13101/129803547)

### Requirements
> Design a multiplayer interactive networked game	that is	played in real-time	(i.e., not turn based) between an unknown number of participants. The system must support the following	things:
> - Scaling up as the number of participants grows. Discuss performance aspects as a function of the number of users. If your design sets a maximum number of users, justify the choice	and	explain	why	it is needed.	
> - Quick response times to actions of other users	
> - Ability to download new game settings (possibly large files, e.g., graphics with textures)	
> Note that because of firewalls and NATs, you cannot	assume that	the	participants are always	able to	initiate connections with others
